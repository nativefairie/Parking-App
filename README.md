# ParkingApp

Project Premise
---------------

Bucharest can be crowded, so looking all over for a parking spot has never been anyone's favorite activity. Taking that into account, the parking app could save us a lot of time. It simulates a parking with 87 parking spots randomly distributed. Let's assume it's Politehnica's main parking (though designing the real Politehnica's parking wouldn't be such trouble, I would rather focus on code). 

Assigning yourself a spot means clicking on a free (green) spot and checking in from the newly appeared modal window. 

You can let other people know how much you will be staying by selecting a time interval. They can see it by clicking on your parking spot which is marked as red (busy). 

If the parking lot is full and you are looking for spot, the app will let you know if there are people estimated to leave in less than 15 minutes (orange). If they don't leave in that time, the spot will get red (busy) again.

If you forget checking out, no worries, you'll automatically be checked out at 00:00. 

If you are the dean or a teacher, the system admin can make your spot unavailable (grey) so you won't have to worry about checking in and out.

When checking in you will recieve an email with the current parking spot you're on and estimated time of staying. 

If unfortunatelly you scratched someone's car you can view informations such as email of that person to contact him/her.

You can view in which day of the week the parking lot is the busiest.
