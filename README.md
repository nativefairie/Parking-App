# ParkingApp

Project Premise
---------------

Bucharest can be crowded, so looking all over for a parking spot has never been anyone's favorite activity. Taking that into account, the parking app could save us a lot of time. It simulates a parking with 100 parking spots. Let's assume it's Politehnica's main parking (though designing the real Politehnica's parking wouldn't be such trouble, I would like to focus more on coding). Assigning yourself a spot means clicking on that spot to see it's status. If it's available then you can proceed to check in. You can let other people know how much you will be staying by selecting a time interval. If the parking lot is full and you are looking for spot, the app will let you know if there are people estimated to leave in less than 15 minutes. If you forget checking out, no worries, you'll automatically be checked out at 00:00. 
*Install Illustratotr sau InkScape and build map*

*How it will work as in you check in you check out*
